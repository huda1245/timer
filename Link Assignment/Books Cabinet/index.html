<dd>A chemical formula identifies each constituent element by its chemical symbol and indicates
    the proportionate number of atoms of each element. In empirical formulae, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other
     elements in the compound, by ratios to the key element.</dd>

    <p id="Organic chemistry">Organic chemistry is a sub-field of chemistry that involves studying the molecules of life.
         It is mainly concerned with looking at the structure and behavior of these molecules, which are
          composed of only a few different types of atoms: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and a few
           miscellaneous others. These are the atoms used to construct the molecules that all plants and animals
            require for their survival. Traditional organic chemists are concerned with synthesizing new molecules
             and with developing new reactions that might make these syntheses more efficient. The kinds of molecules
              organic chemists synthesize include useful things like drugs, flavorings, preservatives, fragrances,
               plastics (polymers), and agricultural chemicals (fertilizers and pesticides), and sometimes include
                unusual molecules found in nature or ones that might simply provide a challenge to make. Also, 
                understanding something about organic chemistry is essential for learning about biochemistry and 
                molecular biology because bio-molecules such as proteins, sugars, fats, and nucleic acids
                 (DNA and RNA) are all organic molecules, albeit very large ones. Students who concentrate in
                  organic chemistry typically go on to work in pharmaceutical, food or polymer companies,
                   do research or teach in organic chemistry, pursue medical careers, or may pursue other related  job opportunities.</p>
   <p><a href="#Analytic Chemistry">Analytic chemistry</a></p>
   <p>Analytical chemistry is the science of identification and quantification of 
       materials in a mixture. Analytical chemists may invent procedures for analysis,
        or they may use or modify existing ones. They also supervise, perform, and interpret 
        the analysis. Students concentrating in analytical chemistry often go on to work in
         forensics laboratories, environmental or pharmaceutical companies, work in, manage
          and/or design quality assurance procedures, pursue research, or teach in colleges
          and universities.
