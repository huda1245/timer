        <dd>Physics is the branch of science that deals with the structure of matter
             and how the fundamental constituents of the universe interact. It studies 
             objects ranging from the very small using
             quantum mechanics to the entire universe using general relativity.

<p id="nuclear physics">This is a branch of physics that is concerned with the constituents,
     structure, behaviour and interactions of atomic nuclei. This branch of physics
      is different from that of atomic physics. Latter studies the atom, including 
      its electrons. In contemporary times, nuclear physics has become a very broad 
      area of study and extended its scope manifolds. Methodologies and principles
       of this subject are applied to other academic and research areas. It is used 
       in power generation, nuclear weapons, magnetic resonance, imaging, medicines,
        industrial and agricultural isotopes.

        <a href="mechanics">Mechanics</a>
        <p id="mechanics">Mechanics is a branch of physics that focuses on the movement and motion of physical objects 
            under a force and when at rest. It studies the relationship between different concepts like force, 
        matter and motion. Forces applied to objects result in displacements or changes of an objects
         position relative to its environment. It studies the law of motion, gravitation, 
            friction, displacement and concerts like force, energy and power.</p></address>
